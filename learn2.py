# The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal.
# Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal),
# or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C),
# Pythonâ€™s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string),
# in the order that they appear in the sequence.
#IT MEANS FOR LOOPS EXECUTE A BLOCK OF CODE A FIXED NUMBER OF ITEMS
#YOU SET HOW MANY TIMES IT WILL EXECUTE for **w** (times) in **Words**
